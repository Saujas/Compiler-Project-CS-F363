<<module square>>
takes input [arr: array[2..4] of integer];
start
	print(arr);
	arr[2]:= 100;
end


<<<driver program>>>
start
	declare x:integer;
	declare arr: array[2..4] of integer;
	
	arr[2] := 2;
	arr[3] := 4;
	arr[4] := 6;

	use module square with parameters arr;

	print(arr);
end

**notice that this test case does not declare the module before the driver module, still it is syntactically correct as moduleDeclarations is optional. Testing whether a module is declared before its use is a matter of semantic analysis**

** test the correctness of all lexemes and parse tree created
and print the following message on successful compilation on the console
      " Input source code is syntactically correct.........."
**

**make sure to produce only relevant output of your compiler code...
Also remove all unnecessary printf statements and make the code more professional before submitting**
