** This testcase demonstrates correctness of module structure with declaration and simple statements**
<<<driver program>>>
start
	a := 1+2;
end


**notice that this test case does not declare the module before the driver module, still it is syntactically correct as moduleDeclarations is optional. Testing whether a module is declared before its use is a matter of semantic analysis**

** test the correctness of all lexemes and parse tree created
and print the following message on successful compilation on the console
      " Input source code is syntactically correct.........."
**

**make sure to produce only relevant output of your compiler code...
Also remove all unnecessary printf statements and make the code more professional before submitting**
